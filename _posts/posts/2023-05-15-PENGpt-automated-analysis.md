Recently a friend of mine reched me out asking what my thoughts were regarding the raise of artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT, tools that could help someone that never wrote a line of code to build maybe a malware or do something along that line.

His concern came up when he found out about this particular project called ["PentestGPT"](https://github.com/GreyDGL/PentestGPT) which is an interactive command line tool based on GPT-4 model with the purpose of helping the user to hack and perform penetration testing assessments. 

That being said, no Harlock, I'm not goin to lose my job to a script kiddie with access to ChatGPT, let me explain why once for all.
